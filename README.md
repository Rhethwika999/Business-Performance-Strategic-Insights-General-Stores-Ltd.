# Business-Performance-Strategic-Insights-General-Stores-Ltd. üìä
This Tableau project visualizes company performance, customer value, product trends, and regional sales. It supports data-driven decisions on expansion, contract renegotiation, and improving business profitability.

### The Scenario ‚ùì
- General Stores Limited is a small company based in Reading, UK which supplies products to 
smaller businesses around the country. 
- There is just one central warehouse currently in Reading alongside the offices. However, 
General Stores is thinking about business expansion and maybe a second warehouse 
somewhere else in the UK. No decision has yet been taken and they are thinking about 
whether it makes sense to put a warehouse in another region. 
- The business has customers which it currently ranks in importance as High, Medium, Low. 
This is a grading that management believes to be the relative importance of the customers to 
the business. However, they did this grading several years ago by guesswork so no-one really 
knows if this grading is correct. 
- Data Entry quality has also been a problem at General Stores with a recently assessed 3-5% 
data error. The company is looking at improving this, but this is still work in progress. Some 
areas of the business are having real problems and it would be useful to identify some issues 
or trends in the data and propose ways to fix these. 
- All the 21 customers have recently been reviewed by their account managers and are known 
to have made orders in 2024. Therefore we know all the customers are currently active and 
doing business. 
- The task is to produce some operational reports for the business that can be presented at 
the next management meeting. At that meeting, we are also scheduled to speak about 
business direction & development for the next 2 years but as a separate agenda topic.



### Project Goals üéØ

- Identify and flag data quality issues, suggest fixes, and prepare a rectification report.  
- Build dashboards to visualize revenue, profit, monthly and regional performance (2024 YTD).  
- Analyze customer base to identify top and underperforming clients and review grading accuracy.  
- Evaluate product and category performance to guide future business focus.  
- Recommend potential regions for new warehouse expansion based on sales trends.  
- Identify customers for contract renegotiation to boost revenue and profitability.
